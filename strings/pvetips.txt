In the USCM, every marine is a specially trained technician capable of performing repairs and maintenance on various USCM equipment, from vehicles to rifles to blast doors.
A desperate attempt at surviving in the modern age, the formation of the UPP came directly as a result of the European Union's prior dissolution, spurred by mass famine, a collapse of societal structures, and a general abandonment of support and relations from the recently formed United Americas and Three World Empire.
The Service or Jail Act is a legislation in the United Americas that permits incarcerated individuals to enlist in the USCM to avoid jail time provided they are capable of meeting the strict requirements of service.
USCM Platoons on the Golden Arrow are formed by 11 marines—two squads of four, a corpsman, a platoon sergeant, and the platoon's commanding officer. Squads are split into two teams, a gun team comprised of a rifleman and a smartgunner, and a rifle team consisting of the squad leader and a rifleman.
Weyland-Yutani and the Three World Empire have close relations, with the exception of the Royal Marine Commandos, the TWE's primary military force is backed up by Weyland-Yutani's private military contractors.
Despite popular belief, the USCM and UPP are not in a proper war. Over the centuries, what will and won't cause all-out war has shifted. Skirmishes in the outer fringes of space between the UPP and the United Americas are frequent and the use of nuclear weapons is almost as common as missile attacks were in the 21st century.
The USCM operates on a fast response doctrine, patrolling the outer reaches of the territories of the United Americas and ready to deploy at a moment's notice.
Typical operations for the marines in the USCM involve handling minor things for the outer colonies. If a colony stops sending all clear signals, a ship is tasked to investigate. More often than not it is a transmitter or relay satellite that was disabled for one reason or another, though they do frequently respond to civil riots and quell worker strikes on colonies where the CMB, if even present, are incapable of handling the situation.
The Office of the Colonial Marshals, otherwise known as the OCM and frequently referred to as the CMB is a law enforcement agency responsible for policing colonial centers and space stations. Often colonies are too small to even warrant a presence of the Colonial Marshals and simply rely on self policing. If the CMB can't handle something or aren't present, it's up to the USCM to deal with the problem.
The M577 APC is the most lightly armored vehicle in the USCM arsenal and operates as a mobile command center for a marine platoon, though due to it's fragile nature marines tend to frown upon it's use in the field.
Capable of a max speed of Mach 8, the UD-4 "Cheyenne" Dropship is a combat utility spacecraft used by the USCM. Though not built to enage in significant with ground or space defenses, the UD-4 is capable of withstanding a significant beating while still remaining airborne. Despite this, even light damage can prevent it from exiting the atmosphere of a planet.
Excluding the Commanding Officer and synthetic support units, most USCM vessels only carry combat personnel aboard. Any supply, engineering, or medical duties are carried out by the marines themselves. Repairs too complex for marines are carried out by synthetics, with surgeries being handled by an autodoc suite. Occasionally a vessel may employ additional support staff in the form of doctors, engineers, and requisitions personnel, though this is uncommon.
Military Police are not a frequently present force aboard marine ships, with the bulk of disciplinary action being carried out by the NCOs of the vessel.
USCM FTL is highly dangerous, utilizing a tachyon shunt to get from one destination to the other, speeding up time in the ship itself. Anyone not in hypersleep is, for lack of a better description, is forced into a tachyonic state, undergoing psychosis and rapid aging before quicky succumbing to the effects. Synthetics, however, are still capable of operating while a tachyon shunt is underway. Even with this process, the fastest vessels often take several days or even weeks to reach their destinations.
With the National Security Act of 2101, the USCM and Weyland-Yutani, among other corporations, have a close relationship. As such, the USCM may be activated as a short term security force in mutual corporate interests.
Launched from drydock less than a year prior, the destruction of the original Bougainville-class Golden Arrow in June 2182 put the United Americas PR department in a mad scrmable to save the reputation of the Bougainville class as a whole, having only been put into service January 2182. Officially, the Golden Arrow is listed as a Bougainville on all official records despite it's class actually being a Conestoga, and as such being much larger than official records state. This quick response has led to there being several hour long delays in docking due to not having an unoccupied dock capable of fitting the sheer size of a Conestoga.
The United Americas Allied Command (UAAC) is the overarching joint command of all United American militaries—all United States, Latin America, and Canadian armed forces are under it— and as estabilished by the Washington Treaty, it is tasked with maintaining the collective security of all UA signatories and their recognized interstellar colonies. The UAAC is formed by the United States Army, United States AeroSpace Force (USASF), Latin American Colonial Navy (LACN), Canadian Colonial Armed Forces (CCAF), United Americas Outer Rim Defense Fleet (ORDF) and of course, the United States Colonial Marine Corps (USCM)
Remember to interact with your comrades before you drop, play games, talk about your lives. You'll never know if you'll ever get to see them after the mission is done.
The current year is 2182.
The United Americas Colonial Guard (UACG) is a reservist and home guard force formed by local colonists, having only basic training. They are usually activated to assist in natural disaster relief or in times of civil unrest to augment the Colonial Marshal Bureau.
Joining the Colonial Marines isn’t the nonstop action the movies or ads promise, but mostly boring grunt work: patrols where nothing happens, humanitarian work, solving technical issues from isolated colonies, muscle-flexing colonists for a corporation, and the occasional low-stakes skirmishes against minor rebel "cells" and pest control against hostile alien fauna.
The Interstellar Commerce Commission (ICC) is a multinational central organization which regulates, monitors and oversees interstellar trade. All commercial trade vessels and crew members are required to hold an ICC licence. The ICC holds a considerable amount of power, as they can enforce planetary and system quarantines, and organise and coordinate "police actions" and other military operations against colonies that had been for one reason or another declared in fragrant violation of ICC regulations.
Seegson is a minor competitor of Weyland-Yutani, covering a wide range of products like any self-respecting megacoporation. Its strategy to compete with such a titan of a corporation is to sell cheaper but more primitive forms of technology, most famously their Working Joe synthetics and APOLLO AI supercomputers. Weyland-Yutani on the other hand, don't see them as a major threat to their business.
Lasalle Bionational is a major multinational conglomerate specializing in biological research and development. Lasalle was formed in the mid-2130s by former Weyland-Yutani executives and personnel, they are known mostly for their bioengineered crops and livestock, extrasolar pathogen vaccines, and more sinisterly, bioweapons, with which they are locked in a bitter arms race against Weyland-Yutani.
Terraforming is a relatively common process, which can be achieved by the Atmospheric Processing Plant (APPs), gigantic automated reactors capable of "converting" an unbreathable, toxic or otherwise inhospitable atmosphere into one suitable for human habitation, as well the introduction of engineered fauna and flora.
Currency include the UA dollars, TWE yen, and the UPP yuen. Corporations also have their own currencies, such as the W-Y Colony Dollar, widely regarded as the dominant reserve currency. Other corporate-issued tenders include the less valuable Seeg Bills backed by Seesong, and "Binat Coins", tokens that are made of a mixture of standard and precious metals, ranging from steel, copper, and platinum to even rarer earthmetals.
Intersystem communication is very expensive and slow, with messages taking days, weeks to months to go through. Such technology is possible through a sophisticated grid of satellites and antenna arrays known as "the Network".
In 2160, the United Americas launched an assault on the Chinese/Asian-Nation Cooperative’s (CANC) interstellar colonies along the Chinese Arm, citing allegations of bioweapons stockpiling. This marked the beginning of the Dog War (so named because the Chinese Arm lies in the Canes Venatici constellation). Although the Union of Progressive Peoples (UPP) later entered the conflict in support of CANC, their efforts proved futile. The war ended in 2163 with the United Americas seizing control of the Chinese Arm and the eventual absorption of the CANC into the UPP.
While the Chinese/Asian-Nation Cooperative (CANC) was weakened and absorbed into the UPP, there are still scattered remnants who refuse to fold into the UPP, keep fighting a guerilla war against both UA and UPP.
The United States AeroSpace Force (USASF) is the “space navy” branch responsible for spacelift capability, aerospace combat and supporting planetary assaults. It was formed from merging elements of the United States Air Force and United States Navy. It works closely with the Colonial Marines.
The Ministry of Space Security (MSS) serves as the UPP’s intelligence and security agency, maintaining a formidable espionage network aimed at countering both internal dissent and external threats.
The Royal Marine Commandos (RMC) are officially the elite fighting force of the TWE, known for their intense training, strict professionalism, and cutting-edge gear… at least on paper. In reality, the TWE has largely outsourced its defense and security to private contractors, leaving the RMC undersized, underutilized, and rarely deployed.
The Space Operating Forces (SOF) is the UPP’s answer to the USCM: a highly-mobile, autonomous force in constant readiness for power projection and rapid response to threats against UPP-aligned colonies. It operates its own spacecraft and Naval Infantry forces. Their members are career professional volunteers (and not conscripts) and highly-trained.
Besides the Colonial Marshal Bureau, some other law enforcement within American space include the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the United States Colonial Coast Guard (USCCG).
Alongside the Royal Marine Commandos (RMC), is the Imperial Armed Space Forces (IASF) which consists of the combined force of the TWE's Naval, Ground and Aerospace assets.
The United Americas (UA) is a major
The Three-World Empire (TWE or 3WE) is a major
The Union of Progressive Peoples (UPP) is a major
The Indepedent Core System Colonies (ICSC) is the name of a a loose confederation of privately-owned worlds located in the Core Systems. All colony worlds in the ICSC have their own independent governments, many of which were overseen by corporations.
The ECA or Extrasolar Colonisation Administration is a UA organisation dedicated to supporting and monitoring UA colonies.
One of the fiercest recent conflicts involving the USCM was the Linna 349 Campaign. The United Americas intervened on a TWE-controlled planet to suppress a local rebellion of Australian sympathizers — nicknamed the "Bug Boys" by the Marines. The brutal campaign ended in a decisive USCM victory, with the United Americas establishing a peacekeeping force on Linna 349, despite strong objections from the Three World Empire.
Some Marines swear that every M56 Smartgun have their own personality. Some track targets flawlessly, others lag or spray wildly, and a few go completely haywire, chasing phantom threats or glitching at the worst possible moment. Common rule of thumb amongst smartgunner is: if you find one that works right, you never let it go.
“Colonial Liberation Front” as an organization doesn’t exist. Instead, there are dozens of Rebel and Insurgent movements spread across planets and systems with various sizes and ideologies.
“Cornbread” is a popular staple food among colonists and space workers. It is bland, dry,tasteless, and don’t taste like cornbread at all, but it’s very cheap to prepare and store the ingredients.
